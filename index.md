# About the Workshop  
![About Image](../pages/images/aboutsite.jpeg)

---

This interdisciplinary workshop is broadly anchored in five themes:
1. How do African institutions, ideas, and processes shape the historical production,
consumption, and preservation of media from the late 16th century to the present?
2. How are reading publics and cultures built, shaped, and sustained by media including ‘new
media’? How have media changed over time and how have various forms of media influenced
one another?
3. What is the relationship between media and power? How do production and circulation shape
various cultures, broadly defined, across African history?
4. How might we explore the impact of media from Africa into the World? How can various
forms of media from Africa fully contribute to the creation of black/Black archives on a global
scale? How can we study the circulation of African-based and black/Black press into spaces not
delineated by borders and across the diaspora?
5. How can we retheorize the positionalities, contributions, and embodied knowledges of girls,
mothers, grandmothers, queens, spiritualists, diviners, market-women, gender, and sexuality
evinced through media? How might we more closely examine their contributions to the
production of political, social, intellectual, economic, and affective knowledges and cultures
through media?
