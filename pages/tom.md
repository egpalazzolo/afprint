## Thomas Keegan  
Thomas is a Ph.D. Candidate in History at Johns Hopkins University with an M.A from the University of Cape Town. He is a historian of colonial Africa with interest in West African intellectual history and political thought in a global perspective. His dissertation examines print culture in British colonial West Africa in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The dissertation traces how public ideas of nationalism, Pan-Africanism and race were contested, produced, and consumed in their social and commercial forms in print, and highlights the generative role of margins and the central role of conflict in African intellectual history. Select fellowships and grants he has received include the Butler Fellowship, the Russell-Wood Grant, the Deanâ€™s Teaching Fellowship Award, and more. His publishing portfolio includes work in an upcoming Cambridge University Press volume edited by Karin Barber and Stephanie Newell.
